# Monorepo for the Sphene Family of Projects

### This is a monorepo for the 3 Sphene (CaTiSiO5) projects.

## [Sphene](./sphene/README.md)

Sphene is a discord bot that replaces twitter links with various other sources that aim to fix the bug/broken embeds twitter has nowadays.

### Example

## [Titanite](./titanite/README.md)

Titanite is (loosely) based on [Sphene](https://github.com/AnnsAnna/sphene) with completely different goals and vastly different features. 

This version downloads the image of the tweet and includes a backlink to the original tweet. It is intended for preservation (Basically a Twitter/X bookmarks alternative that is actually good). It supports images, videos, text and mosaics, always trying to find the best way to showcase the content as directly as possible.

When sending it a tweet via DMs it'll automatically send it to a designated channel, it'll also include the original tweet link for easier moving to other channels / categories.

### Example

## [Thorium](./thorium/README.md)

Thorium is a library to handle twitter links.
